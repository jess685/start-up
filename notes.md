### GitHub
Git provides two things, 1) Version tracking in a repository, and 2) the ability to clone a copy of the repository to a different location.

GitHub is going to be used for three things:
1. Hosting all of this instruction. Because it is hosted on GitHub you can generate pull requests when you see things that need improvement.
2. Publicly hosting your project repositories. This creates a backup copy of your code, demonstrates your progress with your commit history, allows for reviews of your code, and makes it so you can collaborate with your peers. 
3. Keeping notes about what you have learned and things you want to remember

Pattern for development process:
- Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
- Make changes to the code
- Commit the changes (git commit)
- Push the changes to GitHub (git push)
